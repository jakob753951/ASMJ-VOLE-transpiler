# ASMJ-VOLE-transpiler

Small project i made as a joke.
It transpiles a custom assembly-like language i made called ASMJ to a state in the VOLE simulator (a small simulation of a cpu + a little ram)

## Usage
To use the compiler, simply run asm.py with python3.9 with the source path and destination path as inputs.

Example:
```
python asm.py source.asmj destination.vole
```
