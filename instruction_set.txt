MOVE [XY] R  | Moves the data at the address XY into register R
MOVE XY R    | Moves the literal data XY into register R
MOVE R [XY]  | Moves the value in register R to the address XY
MOVE A B     | Moves the value in register A into register B
IADD A B D   | Does INTEGER addition on the values in registers A and B and puts the result into register D
FADD A B D   | Does FLOATING POINT addition on the values in registers A and B and puts the result into register D
OR A B D     | Applies the OR operation on the values in registers A and B and puts the result into register D
AND A B D    | Applies the AND operation on the values in registers A and B and puts the result into register D
XOR A B D    | Applies the XOR operation on the values in registers A and B and puts the result into register D
ROTATE R X   | Rotates the bits in register R, X times
JUMP mark    | Jumps to the mark
CJUMP R mark | Jumps to the mark only if the value in register R is equal to the value in register 0, otherwise does nothing
